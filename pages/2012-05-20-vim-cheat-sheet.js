            <p>
                Since I have been using Vim almost exclusively lately I made myself
                a cheat sheet to help me remember some stuff.  This is certainly not
                an exhaustive list, just some things that I donâ€™t know how to do off
                the top of my head that I wrote down and ended up getting a little
                carried away.  Just thought I would share:
            </p>

            <Disqus />
        </Main>;
    }
}
