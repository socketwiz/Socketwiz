I put the card in my camera but it does a great job of masking that there is a removable drive inside of it.  Normally I don\u2019t care.  I just plug it in and up comes iPhoto ready to pull the images off and remove them from my camera.  So when I plugged her card in, iPhoto dutifully came up\u2026but no pictures.  So I found a free piece of software called ",f("a",{href:"http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec"},"PhotoRec")," that would supposedly extract the data from the memory card if I could only see it.  So with iPhoto up and running I ran the app, but there was no drive to be seen.  For some reason I decided to look around on my Mac to see if by any chance there might be a card reader of some sort and lo and behold right under the CD drive is an SD card reader.  Who knew?
