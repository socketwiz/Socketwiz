When I watched it, I am not sure which I found more amazing, Ruby on Rails or the TextMate editor.  Prior to that I was a big Windows guy and used ",m("a",{href:"http://www.slickedit.com/"}," Visual Slickedit ")," which is an IDE of sorts.  I really liked that you could program multiple languages with it.  I could write scripts or code C++ all from the same environment.  But TextMate seemed like a whole new paradigm to me and I had to have it.  That is when I bought my first Mac, because TextMate only runs on the Mac platform.  I really liked the Bundles technology in TextMate and of course the tab completions.  Tab completions were not available in Slickedit which is sad because they really boost productivity.  The more I used TextMate the more I liked it, although I never really utilized all of its power.

With an IDE you can do things like autocomplete, refactoring, property and method lookups and debugging.  However it has one major problem\u2026it is written and java and therefore it comes with all the problems inherent with java apps like poor memory management and poor performance.
