I have a similar camera and a Mac she has Windows.  Many times I’ve been able to access data on removable drives on my Mac that were inaccessible on Windows but not this time."),p.default.createElement("p",null,"So my first hurdle was how to mount this drive under the file system.  I put the card in my camera but it does a great job of masking that there is a removable drive inside of it.  Normally I don’t care.  I just plug it in and up comes iPhoto ready to pull the images off and remove them from my camera.  So when I plugged her card in, iPhoto dutifully came up…but no pictures.  So I found a free piece of software called ",p.default.createElement("a",{href:"http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec"},"PhotoRec")," that would supposedly extract the data from the memory card if I could only see it.  So with iPhoto up and running I ran the app, but there was no drive to be seen.  For some reason I decided to look around on my Mac to see if by any chance there might be a card reader of some sort and lo and behold right under the CD drive is an SD card reader.  Who knew?  So I plugged her card into the reader and finally it was properly mounted."),p.default.createElement("p",null,"The website for PhotoRec says that as long as you can see the card and the proper size of the card is detected, then there is a very good chance that the data can be recovered.  Luckily this card was reporting the proper size.  Now PhotoRec is a free application and as such it doesn’t have a fancy user interface that just anybody can click around and figure out.
